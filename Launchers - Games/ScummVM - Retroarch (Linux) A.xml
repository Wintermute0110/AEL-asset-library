Okay, so I was able to get this to work using the first method listed here. I tried the second 
method as well (using a .scummvm extension) but was unable to get it to work - it would only 
boot into the ScummVM UI, not a specific game.

So using the first method I'll use Beneath a Steel Sky as an example. I'm using the CD version 
available directly from the ScummVM site.

The game comes in a zip named bass-cd-1.2.zip.

1) Unzip the contents so that you now have a folder named bass-cd-1.2

2) Rename the folder to "sky" (from the short name list found here)

3) Direct Retroarch (via Launchbox in this case) to any file contained within that folder (I 
used the sky.dsk file)

It launches directly into the game.

I don't have Launchbox at my disposal here at work, but you can achieve the same result as 
Launchbox by using a custom Windows shortcut so that's what I did to test it. I created a 
shortcut to Retroarch.exe, right-clicked and selected properties, in the target field after 
Retroarch.exe I added in -L "cores\scummvm_libretro.dll" "Roms\ScummVM\sky\sky.dsk". This is 
the same thing you're doing via LB with an emulator entry + associated platform.

  <plot>ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed! ScummVM supports many adventure games, including LucasArts SCUMM games (such as Monkey Island 1-3, Day of the Tentacle, Sam &amp; Max, ...), many of Sierra's AGI and SCI games (such as King's Quest 1-6, Space Quest 1-5, ...), Discworld 1 and 2, Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken Sword 1 and 2, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of Kyrandia 1-3, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games (including Freddi Fish and Putt Putt games) and many more. </plot>
