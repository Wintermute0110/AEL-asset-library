  <plot>The TurboGrafx-16 was the first video game console to have a CD-ROM peripheral, and first device ever to use CD-ROM as a storage medium for video games. NEC released the CD-ROM² (シーディーロムロム Shī Dī Romu Romu?, officially pronounced "CD-ROM-ROM") in Japan on December 4, 1988, and released the TurboGrafx-CD in the United States on August 1, 1990.

The TurboGrafx-CD had a launch price of $399.99, and did not include any bundled games. Fighting Street and Monster Lair were the TurboGrafx-CD launch titles; Ys Book I & II soon followed.</plot>
