## Image sizes ##

Icons should have a size of `256x256` or `512x512` pixels. [Kodi Wiki, Add on structure Icon]

Fanart should have 16:9 aspect ratio. We recommend a `1280x720` JPEG image. It should certainly 
be no larger than `1920x1080`. [Kodi Wiki, Add on structure Fanart]

Banners sould have a size of `758 x 140` pixels. [Kodi Wiki, Wide banner icons]

Posters should have an aspect ratio 2:3, so pixel sizes of `666x1000` and `1000x1500` whould be
OK. [Kodi Forum, Poster art size question]
