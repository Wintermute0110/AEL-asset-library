      If a category named 'SONY' already exists this launcher will be added inside that category.
      If the category does not exist it will be automatically created. Note that this created
      category will not have any metadata or assets.
      Use 'root_category' or leave the <category> tag blank to place the launcher in the addon root.

      NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
      This tag specifies an NFO file to read the metadata from. This is to share the metadata
      among different XML configuration files and to not duplicate information. The metadata in the
      launcher NFO file is: year, genre, developer, rating and plot. If any metadata tag is included 
      in the XML file it overrides any metadata on the NFO file.

      If platform is not in AEL official platform names it will set automatically to Unknown (after
      warning the user about this).
      Here is a list of AEL official platform names:

      <args_extra> can be used as many times as necessary. Al launching time, AEL will show
      a select dialog and the user can choose the arguments to launch the ROM from the list.
      For example, this is useful to select the Retroarch core or the MAME machine name.
      Note that if <args_extra> is not used and there is only one set of arguments defined by
      <args> there won't be any select dialog.
  -->

      If <ROM_path> does not exists a YES/NO dialog shows up to tell if the directory should be
      created or not.

      If <ROM_asset_path> does not exists a YES/NO dialog shows up to tell if the directory should be
      created or not. Note that if <ROM_asset_path> does not exists or could not be created then
      the ROM artwork paths will be left unconfigured.

      This tag configures the assets of the launcher itself. Image files must be on the same
      directory as this XML configuration file. AEL will search for graphic files having the 
      following names:
          a) <Asset_Prefix>_[icon|fanart|banner|poster|clearlogo|controller].[png|jpg|gif]
          b) <Asset_Prefix>_[icon|fanart|banner|poster|clearlogo|controller]_NN.[png|jpg|gif]

      If several images are present then AEL will show a dialog and user chooses which image to
      import. For example: 'PlayStation_icon_1.jpg' and 'PlayStation_icon_2.jpg'.

      Image files may have an optinal comment at the end of the filename. For example:
          a) 'PlayStation_fanart_Artist_Name.jpg'
          b) 'PlayStation_fanart_1_Artist Name.jpg'
          c) 'PlayStation_fanart_01_Artist Name.jpg'
    -->
  <Asset_Prefix>PlayStation</Asset_Prefix>
  <!--
       When using the XML file to configure a launcher for the first time it is not recommended
       to use these tags. When AEL exports an XML configuration, these tags will have the
       corresponding artwork so it could be restored during a Categories/Launchers XML backup.
       During the XML import process, the user will choose the artwork from here and also from 
       the artwork found using the <Asset_Prefix> tag.
